# [MamoLinux](https://hsbasu.github.io/mamolinux)

In Sanskrit, *Mamo* means *My*. In a world full of OSes like Windows, Mac, or android, a laptop/computer cannot be called **my Laptop/computer/phone** unless I have full control over it both in software and hardware regime. Such freedom can only be enjoyed on Linux based OSes. Many Ubuntu/Debian-based OSes have been able create an user-friendly OS environment for intermediate computer users. However, they're still far more intimidating to my Li'l sister and Gramps compared to Windows.
MamoLinux is a customized Linux-based(Ubuntu) Operating System and aims to achieve features like:
1. Free-ness (As in Freedom) of Linux,
2. User-friendliness of MS Windows,
3. Beauty and elegance of Mac or OS-X
